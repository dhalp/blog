I"î<p>Aaronâ€™s Holdings (originally trading as AAN) is a retail Lease to Own (LTO) firm with two main business segments: Virtual Lease to Own, and Brick and Mortar Retail Lease To Own.  Earlier this year management announced their intention to spinoff their retail business from their virtual least to own segment in a 2:1 ratio which was set to value the retail segment at $1.3bln and the VLTO segment at $3bln.  Somewhat unusually, AAN will be the <em>spinoff</em> component.  Aarons created a holding company for the SpinCo and will rename the RemainCo to Progressive concurrently with the spinoff transaction.  At the onset, the virtual LTO looks component looks more attractive.  Since the acquisition of Progressive Finance Holdings in 2014 for $700m.  The Progressive segment has continued to grow like gangbusters with an average annual growth rate of around 25% compounded.  The recent activity separating AAN from Progressive (PROG) returns the two segments to their separate pre-2014 formats.</p>
